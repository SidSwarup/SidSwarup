<p>A million dollar (literally) question.  

<p>The most praised attribute of the cloud is the elasticity. It's not just capacity elasticity but also configuration elasticity. Do you need a new network? No problem, one click or one API call and here comes your new network. Same for storage or VPN endpoints or almost anything. With your own datacenter, you have your own elasticity, it's elastic only to the degree you thought about in advance, sometimes years in advance. You need just 70 servers today, and that would fit in 2 racks, so you order 4 in the cage at the facility, using a part of the 3rd rack for your networking gear and considering the rest as the room to grow. Then your company suddenly grows faster than you anticipated (say, 2x) and oops. You need to lease *another* space in this facility (and you are lucky if they have necessary space), build a completely new infrastructure there and then seamlessly migrate your workloads. Which means you are paying twice for the extended period, plus mistakes, outages, lots of all-nighters and the whole nine yards.

<p>CTO/BTO servers have lead times from 3 weeks to a couple of months, so if you have to have spare computing capacity (room to grow, elasticity) you have to keep this capacity in your own storage room. Storage units typically have even longer lead times. Network gear also requires purchasing of expensive equipment with extended lead times and then complex cabling.
